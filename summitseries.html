    <h2>In 1972, an eight-game hockey series took place between Canada and the Soviet Union. Intended to improve relations between the two rivals, it ended up as the closest thing to open conflict ever experienced between the two nations.</h2>

        <time>Before</time>
        <p>After the Second World War, the western countries and the Soviet Union turned from allies to enemies. In the 1950s, the division between communist and non-communist nations deepened until the two sides teetered on the brink of nuclear warfare. Known as the "Cold War," it was a situation that threatened to escalate worldwide.</p>

        <time>Canada</time>
        <p>Reigning Stanley-Cup winner Harry Sinden was named head coach and John Ferguson - originally invited as a player, just before he retired - was named his assistant. All Canadian pro players were considered for Team Canada's roster and almost all of the country's best talent was represented - Bobby Hull, J.C Trembley and a few others were not allowed to participate, as they had just left the NHL for the rival WHA league, while Bobby Orr was selected but was injured...though the Soviets did allow Canada to keep an extra roster spot open for him. The 35 men selected to represent their country came from 10 different NHL clubs with as many hockey cultures and, like any all-star lineup, were more a collection of exceptional individual talents than a truly cohesive team; the three-week training camp focussed more on the combined scoring prowess of Team Canada, rather than on their defensive needs.</p>

        <time>Game One</time> <p>On a sweltering night in Montreal, many in Canada tuned in to watch Game One of the series. Viewers saw Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau perform the ceremonial face-off, which Esposito aggressively won, underlying the "enormity and importance" of the event, recalls Ken Dryden. Esposito was the only player the Soviets openly admitted to fearing before the series.</p>

        <time>Game Two</time><p>Dennis Hull recalls that the intensity of Team Canada's practices picked up before Game Two and if the first game was Russia's coming-out party, the second - in Toronto, with the Prime Minister and Tim Horton watching from the stands - was the Canadians' coming-home party.</p>

        <time>Game Three</time><p>It was a warm evening in Winnipeg and the sub-standard ice conditions played a part in the 4-4 final, as pucks bounced for both sides during an even, hard-hitting affair. While Bobby Hull watched from the stands, Hewitt remarked that both the Soviets and Canadians relied on "team effort rather than individual effort" throughout the match.</p>

        <time>Game Four</time><p>In a fine example of foreshadowing, Esposito was referred to as the "captain" of Team Canada during the opening ceremonies in Vancouver, though no captain officially existed.

Canada moved eight new players into its line-up and Hewitt noted that the team looked as disorganized as it had in Game One. Forward Wayne Cashman remembers how the team was out-conditioned by the Russians, who played an exceptionally hard-hitting, tight-checking, positional game, perhaps their best performance of the series.</p>

        <time>Stockholm</time><p> The Soviets returned home to play another tournament before hosting the final four games of the Summit Series, all to take place in Moscow.

Team Canada took a few days off before flying to Sweden, to adapt to the different time zones and international ice sizes. Their week-long stay in Stockholm involved games against the Swedish national team - a 4-1 win and 4-4 tie, where Esposito scored shorthanded in the last minute - and introduced the Canadians to the two German referees who would officiate in Moscow, and who appeared sub-standard, at best; one was later accused of being a pro-Soviet East German. Team Canada was often penalized for retaliating to uncalled Swedish stick infractions - including one that split Cashman's tongue apart, ending his series. (The local papers only mentioned his cross-check of the Swedish captain, neglecting to mention the high stick to Cashman's mouth.)</p>

        <time>Moscow</time><p>It is remarkable, considering that the Cold War was in full swing, that around 3,000 Canadians decided to travel deep into enemy territory - behind communist Europe's "Iron Curtain" - to support a hockey team; but they did, becoming the largest group of tourists allowed into the country since before the Russian Revolution of 1917. The authorities warned Team Canada fans that they would not be allowed to wave their flags in the streets or in the arena. In fact, no boisterous behaviour of any sort was allowed.</p>

        <time>Game Five</time><p>For most Canadians watching Game Five at home, this was their first glimpse into the secretive Soviet Union, and technical issues plagued the satellite images as they bounced from Moscow to Helsinki to London and across the Atlantic to Canada. They saw a rabid collection of Canadian fans who waved flags, sang and celebrated wildly in defiance of the police presence; the next morning one local newspaper ran a story that assured readers the roof had withstood the ruckus.</p>

        <time>Big, Bad Bear</time><p> The Soviet Union was a place where the government routinely bullied and intimidated its citizens into submission and now it turned its attention to Team Canada. The harassment came in several forms, including having the food and drink they brought disappear and numerous late-night phone calls intended to ruin their sleep. One of the more raucous Canadian fans was even detained - and threatened with five years of prison time in Siberia - for playing a trumpet in the stands.
But Team Canada did not break because of this additional pressure. Sinden says the team felt it couldn't let their country down.</p>

        <time>Game Six</time><p>Team Canada's supporters were even louder this time out and Hewitt said they sounded more like a crowd of 20,000.

The Russian fans were noticeably vocal when their team opened the scoring, but were soon quietened and drowned out when Canada scored three quick, unanswered goals on its way to a 3-2 victory; Hewitt told the millions watching at home that the rough, hard-hitting affair was "the hardest fought game I think I've seen in years" and reminded him of when the Penticton Vees defeated the Soviets in 1955 at the IIHF World Championships. Conacher said it best: "it's just sheer war" on the ice.</p>

        <time>Game Seven</time><p>Team Canada's solid victory in Game Six - playing "our game" and "our style" on a night when it snowed in Moscow - whipped the nation into a further frenzy before Game Seven and huge numbers of people tuned in to watch. Hewitt told them that, regardless of the outcome, the Soviets have won a moral victory by proving their hockey players seem to be "comparable to our best."</p>

        <time>Game Eight</time><p>Before the start of Game One, Hewitt said that the series between Canada and the Soviet Union promised to be sensational; before the start of Game Eight, he added that "if you were writing the script, it couldn't have produced a more dramatic final."

As Team Canada skated out to roaring cheers, it had no way of knowing the magnitude of the effect it had on a nation. Businesses closed, schools stopped teaching and, though exact numbers are impossible to calculate, some estimate that 18 million of Canada's 22 million residents were in front of a television.</p>

        <time>After</time><p>Team Canada had little time to relax and reflect, as they still had a game to play in Prague against the Czechoslovakian national team (the reigning world champions at the time). Czech-born Stan Mikita received the loudest ovation most of his team-mates ever heard when he was announced. Serge Savard scored with only four seconds left to snatch a 3-3 tie; at one point, on the Canadians' travels home, Phil Esposito hummed "Thanks for the Memory" and the whole team sang along.</p>
